Devcars.js
================

See https://github.com/bhauman/devcards
Then try to come back to the old world of js-land.

This project aims at doing the same as did Dan Abramov, bring back
some of the good tricks from more functional language to Js.

This time I aims at Devcards.
They are quite simple at the essence.
Just some simple React components with some nice features attached to them.

Should definitively read this: http://rigsomelight.com/devcards/#!/devdemos.core
And watch this: https://vimeo.com/97078905

I wont give more explanantion, Bruce Hauman did a great job at this.
Plus I don't intend to create features that don't exists in clojurescript's devcards.
